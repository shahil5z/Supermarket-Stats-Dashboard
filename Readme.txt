Project Description: The "Supermarket Stats Dashboard" represents a significant milestone project I've developed as part of my university project.
		This project serves as a practical demonstration of data science and data visualization applied within the retail and sales domain,
		showcasing the knowledge and skills I've acquired during my studies.

Project Features:

Dataset View:
	- You can view and explore the dataset.
	- You have the ability to scroll through the data conveniently using the provided scrollbar.

Dashboard View:
	- Navigate to the "Dashboard" view to explore variety of data visualizations.

Chart-1:
	- You'll find a pie chart displaying city-based sales analysis.
	- This chart provides percentages and labels for different cities and their sales.

Chart-2:
	- Visualize revenue across product segments with a horizontal bar chart.
	- You can observe sold counts and product names, each represented with distinct colors for clarity.
	- The chart effectively highlights the minimum and maximum values.

Chart-3:
	- Analyze payment method preferences through a bar chart.
	- The counts for various payment methods are represented by unique colors, and the chart highlights the minimum and maximum values.

Chart-4:
	- Explore a line chart depicting city-wise best sellers.
	- Hover over data points to gain detailed insights about each city and its sales.

Tooltip Feature:
	- The line chart features tooltips for enhanced data point information.
	- Simply hover over data points to view additional information.

Data Export:
	- You can export the displayed dataset to an Excel file.
	- Choose a save location and save the data for further analysis.

User-Friendly Interface:
	- The application offers a user-friendly graphical interface for seamless data exploration and visualization.

Libraries Used:
	- In this project, I utilized Python libraries, including tkinter for the graphical user interface, pandas for efficient data handling and 
	matplotlib for creating data visualizations.

Here's a brief overview of the libraries I used:

pandas:
	- Pandas transformed the dataset from 'supermarket_sales.csv' into a powerhouse, enabling the project to wield the might of
	streamlined data operations, effortless selection, and smooth Excel exports.

matplotlib:
	- Matplotlib played a crucial role in creating the data visualizations in the dashboard. It is an essential library for data representation and analysis.

matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg:
	- I used this library to embed Matplotlib figures into the tkinter-based dashboard, ensuring that the data visualizations seamlessly integrate into the user interface.

matplotlib.ticker.AutoMinorLocator:
	- To enhance the aesthetics and improve the readability of the data visualizations, I used matplotlib.ticker.AutoMinorLocator to control the placement of minor ticks on the axes.
	Additionally, this library was utilized to add gridlines to the graphs, further enhancing their visual appeal and informativeness.
